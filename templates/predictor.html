    <h4> This case study analyzes the differences in how India, South Korea, Italy, and Wuhan have all dealt with the Corona Virus. There is also a predictor that uses machine learning and aritifical intelligence algorithms to predict the future of the virus. This case study utilizes information up to March 24. </h4>

    <h4> In order to visualize the data and start to create a predictor, we can use the pandas library to create a color-coded table that shows the total confirmed cases, cured cases, deaths, and the total amount of cases. The redder a table spot, the greater the amount of cases.</h4>
    <h4> Here are some conclusions we can make based on this data: </h4>
    <ul> 
        <li>Manipur and Mizoram reports their first case. </li>
       <li>  Kerela has crossed Maharashtra in terms of highest number of confirmed cases.</li>
       <li> Haryana and Telengana has the highest count of confirmed Foreign National count. </li>
        <li> Till 25th of March 9 people have died in India </li>
        <li> Kerala, Maharashtra, and karnataka are currently TOP 3 states with maximum number of confirmed cases. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4> Using the folium library, we can look at a map with circle markers and see the areas that have been influenced the most by the pandemic. The larger a circle around an area, the greater the effect. The map helps us reinforce the same conclusions we came to in the earlier table. </h4>

    <h4> We can use the seaborn library to create a bar graph that show the total cases, deaths, and recoveries for the Indian states. It is very interesting how Maharastra has the most deaths but Kerala is the state with the most confirmed cases. </h4>

    <h4>In order to dive deeper, we need to see how the case number is changing over time. When we create graphs using the plotly library to analyze the case totals in India, we can see that there is an exponential growth function. This is also true for Italy and South Korea. We are not analyzing the data for Wuhan in this segment because the data for Wuhan has been poorly recorded. </h4>

     <h4>We also need to figure out how countries are responding to the pandemic. In order to do this, we can once again use the plotly library to create a graph that shows the number of cases in the days after each country hit 100 cases. We can deduce that India's numbers have stayed stagnant, but South Korea and Italy's numbers have drastically increased. This brings up an interesting question: Why does the country with the most people have the least confirmed cases? </h4>
     <h4> The answer to the above question can be found in <a href = "https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-india-51922204"> this </a> news article. "Many experts believe India is also testing below scale because it fears that its under-resourced and uneven public health system could be swamped by patients. India could be buying time to stock up on testing kits and add isolation and hospital beds. \"I know mass testing is not a solution, but our testing appears to be too limited. We need to quickly expand to restrict community transmission, K Sujatha Rao, former federal health secretary and author of But Do We Care: India's Health System. India has eight doctors per 10,000 people compared to 41 in Italy and 71 in Korea. It has one state-run hospital for more than 55,000 people. (Private hospitals are out of reach for most people). India has a poor culture of testing, and most people with flu symptoms do not go to doctors and instead try home remedies or go to pharmacies. There's a scarcity of isolation beds, trained nursing staff and medics, and ventilators and intensive care beds." </h4>

    <h4> With all of this information gathered and analyzed, it is now time to create our machine learning and artifical learning model. Using the prophet library, we can create a prediction for the total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in the next one week. As part of this case study, I have also coded a function that returns a range of values for each statistic that the prophet model generates. In addition to the output in the form of a table, I have also generated graphs that shows the function's prediction as well as the real numbers. These graphs highlight how accurate the model actually is. There are also more detailed graphs that show the overall trend as well as the trend per day. </h4>
